Remember to now batch compile using these .jsfl files.

The files here are only here so they can be tracked by git. To get the Commands to update in Flash you ned to copy these files to Users/Library(hidden folder)/Application Support/Adobe/Flash CS6/en_US/Configuration/Commands/LiteracyPlanet

Once the files are in the correct location you can run them in the Flash IDE by clicking

Flash Menu Bar/Commands/LiteracyPlanet ... 

For 1.5 You can navigate to /development or /development/Application

It doesn't matter because the code will search through ALL subfolders of whatver you choose *except for the blacklist folders of course
